The tasks were solved in a more difficult convention (without importing libraries).

The response structure is as follows:
1. Answer to task one.
2. Answer to the second task.
3. Presentation of my project in full version, in which I was looking for the most efficient method of solving the second task, 
   based on the (correct) assumption that for very large lists the results may be different than for short lists. 
   Depending on the size of the list, there may be more than one answer. List size range: 100 to 100,000,000.

To be honest the point three I also did out of my own curiosity, 
plus I wanted to be able to see how data processing from each method relates to `big O-notation`. 
Additionally - at the end - I conducted similar tests on the set of lists (the same lists) in unsorted manner.

I have attached charts to the task for a better overview of the case, thanks for `matplotlib`.

Processing the code for such large lists (as they are in the script) took about 20 minutes.
